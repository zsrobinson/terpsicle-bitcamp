# Terpsicle v2: build playbook

**How** we build what `SPEC.md` describes. It's written for the orchestrating agent and its subagents, and for any human who picks this up later.

---

## 1. Ground rules

- **`v2` is trunk.** It's the default branch on GitHub, CI runs against it, and it's what gets deployed. `main` keeps v1 for history.
- Work happens on short-lived branches named `v2/<milestone>-<slug>` (e.g. `v2/m1-fit`), each opened as a PR into `v2`.
- **The orchestrator merges** a PR into `v2` (squash) once CI is green and a review pass finds nothing blocking. No one else pushes to `v2` directly, except the orchestrator for trivial doc fixes.
- **Pure logic lives in `packages/core`** and is exhaustively tested. UI components stay thin: they read state, call core functions, and render.
- **Mock data is first-class.** The app runs fully offline against `@terpsicle/fixtures` (`pnpm dev:mock`). Every UI feature is built and tested against fixtures before real data is wired in.
- **Only proven Cloudflare products:** Workers (with static assets and Cron Triggers), R2, and D1. No Queues, Workflows, Durable Objects, Vectorize or AI-product betas.
- **The spec is the tiebreaker.** If something in the spec is ambiguous, pick the option most consistent with its principles (§1), write the choice in the PR description, and move on. Don't stop to ask.

  React app (TanStack Start/Router, shadcn) ─ Zustand stores ─ Dexie (IndexedDB: plans, settings, catalog cache)
  Web Worker (Comlink): catalog index, search, fit, generator
```

- **The catalog is static data.** The scraper publishes per-department files named by content hash, plus a small `manifest.json` that lists each department's current hash.
  - Clients diff the manifest against their IndexedDB cache and fetch only departments that changed.
  - `seats.<hash>.json` is separate and polled every 60 s while the tab is visible.
  - A `schemaVersion` bump in the manifest forces a full refetch.
- **Plans remember what they were built from.** Each saved plan stores a snapshot of its sections' meetings. When the catalog changes, core's `diffPlanAgainstCatalog` produces "moved / cancelled" problems.
- **Share links:** `/?plan=<base64url(deflate(json))>`, versioned, with the codec in core. No server involved.
- **Server functions** are TanStack Start `createServerFn`, validated with zod. There are few of them: this is a mostly static app.

## 4. Stack and conventions

| Area | Choice |
|---|---|
| Language | TypeScript `strict`, ESM everywhere, Node 22 |
| Package manager | pnpm workspaces |
| App | TanStack Start (React 19) with `@cloudflare/vite-plugin`, deployed as one Worker. The app route is client-rendered (`ssr: false`) to keep Worker CPU tiny. |
| UI | Tailwind 4, shadcn/ui (Radix), lucide icons, Geist + Geist Mono, `vaul` for the mobile drawer, `sonner` for toasts |
| State | Zustand (UI and app state), Dexie (persistence). Undo is a snapshot stack in the plans store. |
| Validation | zod 4, shared by ingest, core and server |
| Search | MiniSearch in the worker, with a custom scorer for course codes |
| Worker thread | Comlink |
| Map | MapLibre GL + Protomaps PMTiles (a College Park extract) served from R2; route lines from the precomputed geometry |
| Lint/format | Biome |
| Tests | Vitest (+ `@testing-library/react`, `happy-dom`), `fast-check` for property tests, Playwright (Chromium) for e2e |
| Deploy | `wrangler deploy` from GitHub Actions on push to `v2` |

Code conventions are in `CLAUDE.md`. The short version: small pure functions in core, named exports, no default exports except routes, and no `any`. Comments explain *why*, never *what*. File names are `kebab-case`, components `PascalCase`.

---

## 5. Testing strategy

| Layer | What | Where / tool | Bar |
|---|---|---|---|
| Core logic | every function: fit, legs, problems, plan reducer and undo, generator, search scoring, share codec, ics, catalog diff | Vitest, `packages/core/**/*.test.ts` | ≥ 90% lines; each bug fix gets a regression test |
| Invariants | generator results never overlap and always respect must-haves; the share codec round-trips; undo(apply(x)) = x | fast-check | runs in CI |
| Parsers | SOC HTML → normalized JSON, PlanetTerp, provost calendar | Vitest golden tests on saved real pages in `__fixtures__/` | any parser change updates the goldens deliberately |
| Components | calendar layout, section rows, filters, drawer | Vitest + Testing Library against fixtures | critical states covered |
| Flows | first visit → search → add → switch section via ghost → problem fix → export codes; generate → save 2 plans; share link → save copy; drag a block; travel settings change pills; undo | Playwright against `pnpm dev:mock` | all green in CI |
| Server | server fns and cron with a local D1 and a mocked email sender | Vitest + `wrangler`'s local runtime (Miniflare) | seat alerts are e2e-tested before launch |
| Performance | generator (7 courses × 20 sections) < 200 ms; search keystroke < 16 ms; first load < 1.5 MB compressed | Vitest bench + a Playwright trace in CI | regressions fail CI |

`packages/fixtures` provides builders (`aCourse()`, `aSection()`, `aPlan()`) and a realistic mock term: 60+ courses including CMSC131-style many-section courses, async sections, Saturday meetings, full, low and restricted sections, and TBA instructors.

## 6. Milestones

Each milestone ends with everything green and deployed (once credentials exist). The acceptance criteria are what the orchestrator checks before calling a milestone done.

**M0: Foundations**
- v1 code is already removed. For reference, v1's Testudo selectors are on `main` (`lib/scrape-*.ts`), and the UMD GIS routing calls are on `dev` (`lib/gis.ts`). Brand icons are in `assets/brand/`.
- Set up the pnpm monorepo, TypeScript, Biome, Vitest and Playwright.
- CI workflow (typecheck, lint, test, e2e, build).
- `packages/fixtures`.
- Scaffold TanStack Start on the Cloudflare vite plugin and deploy a hello-world to `*.workers.dev`.
- Accepted when: `pnpm check` passes, CI is green on a PR into `v2`, and the deployed URL serves the shell.

**M1: Core domain** (pure; can start once the schema lands)
- Schema, time, travel legs, fit, problems.
- Plan reducer with undo.
- Share codec, ics, catalog diff, search scoring.
- Generator: bitmask conflicts, merging time-identical sections, fewest-options-first search, top-K, relaxation hints, near-misses.
- Accepted when the testing bar in §5 is met and the benchmarks pass.

**M2: Ingest**
- SOC adapter with golden tests, and delivery inference (in person, blended, online sync, online async).
- PlanetTerp: ratings, reviews and grades with +/−/W.
- Buildings join.
- Routes builder: distances and route geometries, standard and accessible, cached per pair.
- Academic calendar parser.
- Publisher: content-hashed chunks, manifest, seats, changes.
- GitHub Actions workflows.
- Accepted when a real Spring 2027 catalog is published to R2 and validates against the schema.

**M3: App shell and calendar** (against fixtures)
- Top bar with plans (tabs, menu, rename, `+` menu), labeled rail with collapse-on-reclick, sidebar drill-in with breadcrumb, mobile bottom drawer, theme.
- Tooltip layer with shortcuts.
- Calendar: layout, overlaps, tints, Saturday column, async strip, dashed section ghosts (grouped when time-identical, capped), hover and keyboard preview, travel pills, drag to create a block.
- Undo toast. Persistence and remembered state.

**M4: Sidebar features** (against fixtures)
- Courses: color picker, saved for later, first-visit guide.
- Search: filter chips and hover ghosts.
- Course details: instructor groups, fit words and count, seat meter, instructor cards, PlanetTerp-style grade bars.
- Problems.
- Travel: settings, "How?", connections, connection details with the route map.
- Blocks.
- Export: checklist, codes, share link, .ics.
- Shared-link view.

**M5: Generate**
- Generate tab and the `+` entry point.
- Required/optional/"pick N", must-haves, ranking and custom weights.
- Results with thumbnails and equivalent-merging; preview and drill-in; save one or many as plans.
- Relaxations and near-misses.

**M6: Live data**
- Worker `/data/*` from R2 with caching.
- Client manifest diffing, IndexedDB cache, seat polling and freshness label.
- Catalog-change problems.
- Term switcher.
- Accepted when switching from fixtures to live data is a config flag and the e2e tests pass against a recorded live snapshot.

**M7: Backend features**
- On-demand review summaries: a server fn that generates on the first request, stores in R2, coalesces concurrent requests and respects a spend cap; hidden when no key.
- Seat alerts: D1 schema, subscribe/confirm/unsubscribe (with confirmation), dedupe, a cron that diffs changes and emails. Behind a flag until e2e-tested.

**M8: Polish and launch**
- Accessibility pass (keyboard, focus, contrast, screen reader labels on the calendar).
- Empty, loading and error states everywhere.
- Performance budgets.
- Copy pass against the spec's microcopy rules.
- Final e2e run and a production deploy.

**Parallel streams after M0:** core (M1), ingest (M2) and the shell (M3) run at the same time, and meet at the schema in `packages/core/src/schema`. M4 splits into one subagent per tab. M5 depends on M1's generator. M6 and M7 need M2.

## 7. How the orchestrator runs

1. Keep `docs/STATUS.md` on `v2`: milestone checklist, what's in flight, decisions made, known issues.
2. For each task, write a brief: goal, spec sections, files it owns, acceptance tests, and what not to touch. Spawn a subagent in an isolated worktree on a `v2/…` branch.
3. When a subagent returns, run `pnpm check`, read the diff, and run a code-review pass. Fix or bounce back, open or update the PR into `v2`, and merge when green.
4. Contract changes (schema, store shapes) are made by the orchestrator first, then fanned out.
5. After each merge to `v2`, CI deploys. Smoke-check the deployed URL.
6. Never skip or disable a failing test to get to green.

## 8. Operational setup

| Name | Where | Used for |
|---|---|---|
| `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN` | Claude Code environment variables **and** GitHub Actions secrets | wrangler deploy, R2 writes, D1 |
| `CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID` | same two places | wrangler |
| `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` | environment variable → set as a Worker secret by the orchestrator | review summaries (optional; the feature hides without it) |
| `RESEND_API_KEY` + a sending domain | environment variable → Worker secret | seat-alert emails (optional until M7) |

Cloudflare resources the orchestrator creates with wrangler: Worker `terpsicle`, R2 bucket `terpsicle-data`, D1 database `terpsicle`, one Cron Trigger.

GitHub: scheduled workflows only run on the **default branch**, so `v2` must be the default branch.
